## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Legal Document Extraction:**  
  Upload PDF contracts and agreements; extract parties, obligations, dates, and critical clauses in seconds.
- **Hybrid AI + Human-in-the-Loop Review:**  
  Portia agent flags ambiguities and routes them to you — ensuring high-confidence results.
- **Real-Time Risk Analysis:**  
  Instantly identifies missing or risky clauses so you can act before it’s too late.
- **Interactive Insights Dashboard:**  
  Visualize, export, and search structured contract data, deadlines, and risk metrics.
- **Seamless Collaboration:**  
  Multi-user access, notifications, and rapid feedback cycles for audit-ready workflows.

## 🧠 Technical Process Overview

### 1. Contract Upload & Ingestion

*Users upload a PDF through the Next.js frontend.*  
- React dropzone for upload
- Immediate feedback on format, size, duplicates

### 2. AI Extraction (Backend/Portia SDK)

*FastAPI backend manages async document processing:*
- Saves incoming file & metadata
- Kicks off Portia agent with `PDFReader` and legal extraction plan
- Portia parses text, runs custom clause prompts, structures results:
    - **Extracted:** `parties`, `dates`, `obligations`, `clauses`, risk triggers
- **If ambiguity:**  
  - Portia’s planners flag for human input, pausing flow until legal review/response is given (stored to DB, resumes on resolve)
- Stores final structured data + trace for full auditability

### 3. Results Presentation & Dashboard (Frontend)

- Fetches extraction summaries and traces via REST API
- Dynamic table and PDF viewer with highlight overlays
- Real-time updates via long-poll for background jobs
- User can review, submit clarifications and download data as PDF or JSON
